Hello everybody (Bcc'd!)

Thank you for your proposals to the Testing and Automation devroom.
Unfortunately we only have one day and can't fit everybody in. This will be the
second consecutive year of hosting the devroom, and I'm really happy to have
so many proposals from the wide range of automation-focused projects, and
varying kinds of testing.

If you will be coming to FOSDEM, please come find me and say hello, I'd still
like to meet you all in person :)

The confirmed schedule if you're interested is here:

    <https://fosdem.org/$$YEAR$$/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/>


While all the current speakers have confirmed their attendance, there is a
possibility that some of the speakers for the talks listed above cannot make
it, in which case I have some alternates in mind, and I will email you
personally if this happens.

We do still need help running the room, and making sure all the talks are
running smoothly and recorded. If you're interested in volunteering let me
know!

I'm hoping we will be back next year for $$FOSDEMNEXTYEAR$$ and if you'd like I can
email you all if/when we open the CFP for $$NEXTYEAR$$.
